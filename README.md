This project employs Bokeh, a Python library for interactive visualization, to analyze a sample superstore dataset. With 167 rows of data, including various parameters such as child_mortality, exports, health, imports, income, inflation, life_expectancy, total_fertility , gdp the project explores insights through bar graphs and scatter plots. The analysis encompasses income, exports, imports, life expectancy, health, child mortality rate, gdp. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is utilized to delve deeper into sales data by segment and profit data by category. Through these visualizations, the project provides a comprehensive understanding of the superstore's performance metrics and showcases Bokeh's efficacy in data visualization.
